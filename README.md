# bc-dashboard-indicators
NOTE: These indicators assume you are running OSCAR stable build #834 or something more recent.
The indicators can be loaded individually.  If you want to do that read the documentation in the Documentation folder.  However, it is much easier to setup the dashboard panels and indicators by sourcing the script SQL_Scripts/DoBC_dashboard.sql.  The BC billing indicators can be added by sourcing the script SQL_Scripts/bc_billing_dashboard.sql.  The script SQL_Scripts/config_DoBC_dashboard_permissions.sql can be used to give Oscar users permission to use the dashboard.
